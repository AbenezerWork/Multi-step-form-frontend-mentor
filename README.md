## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my biggest web project yet so i learned a lot one of which is planning goes a long way. I also tried out sass for the first time and enjoyed it, I'll look to learn more of that. Learned a bit more on DOM manipulation but I'm still very new to it all.

### Continued development

The biggest thing i think I'm lacking in at the moment is structuring my code and making it reusable and readable. Another related issue I have is from lack of experience and being able to define the structure of the program well before coding it.
